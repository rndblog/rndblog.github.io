Welcome to  one more blog about Research in IT, from Management to Architecture. But wait... **This particular one is an open-source project, based on the GitHub!**

So, if you <S>_want to fix a bug_</S> found mistake, or outdated information or you want to <S>_implement new feature_</S> add something to an article - just go ahead and create pull request!

This is collaborative blog, so you may contribute your own article to the articlebase. Open as Wikipedia, but with workflow as in open-source project. 

And one more thing, every article is marked with an author details plus list of editors, so you may include it to your professional profile. 

**So, we are waiting for you pull requests.**

### What?! Again!

Yes, folks, some time ago I've [started my personal technical blog](http://sotnikdv.github.io/common/2015/03/29/welcome.html) and created few articles. 

Few months later, as many of blog's owners, I've realized that
  - articles may be innacurate or contain mistakes
  - articles become outdated after some time
  - somebody may have more knowledge than you on some topics, so reader potentially can improve article

After some thought I decided, that I need a simple workflow to let readers improve my articles and also I need some way to review their changes and merge. **But wait!.. It's looks like code project!** 

[_If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test). If I need workflow, like in open-source code project, **let my blog be the open-sorce repository-based project!** Simple enough.

Moreover, why it should be personal? Let it be truly open-source project, so every article will have an author and list of editors.

This is why I created this blog and now migrating my articles to it.

### I have my own personal blog, I don't want to work for you!

At least, this blog will allow **you** to change **my** articles, if you'll find mistake or want to make them better. And I'll add you to the list of contributors.

But if you have the same concern about your personal blog and you want to create your article in editable and collaborative blog - feel free to send pull request. Such article will be marked with your name, profile photo and URL to your site. And you may create re-post to your personal blog, up to you.

### What's your interest?

I'm trying to make my own articles better and let people edit them, after some thoughts I decided to migrate from personal blog to collaborative.

### Who will merge changes?

As most of open-source projects - maintainers. Currently it's only me.

### So, this is your blog!

This is open-source project, I'm just mainteiner and author of some articles. You can fork it and change until you are following licenses for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Kasper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) and [Greative Commons License, BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) for content. Keep information about an authors and feel free to evolve.

### Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and ....

Feel free to [fork this blog on a GitHub](https://github.com/rndblog/rndblog.github.io) and don't forget to update settings. Also see [this article from my personal blog](http://sotnikdv.github.io/common/beginners/2015/03/29/do-you-wanna-blog-too.html) for information about configuration and maintenance.

As for content, please preserve information about an author, this is required. Also I'd like to ask you to preserve information about origin (to let reader find main copy) and, if possible, send updates to this upstream.

### I want to me a maintainer too

I see no better way then already used in open-source projects, when top contributors became mainteners. But if you feel that this is not for you - see previous section and good luck!
