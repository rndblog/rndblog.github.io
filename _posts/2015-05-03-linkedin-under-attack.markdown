This is an early notification about existing vulnerability in LinkedIn which was found, investigated and reproduced by me this week.

I'd like to warn all of you and ask you to check LinkedIn settings.

Also, it seems that I saw signs of usage of this vulnerability in the Internet. 

## Impact

**Full access and control on victim's account, if invitation accepted from mail.**  
**Hacker can change password and mails, so victim will not be able to return access except contact to LinkedIn support**

### What to do  

1. **DO NOT accept any invitation by click to button in invitation mail. Independently of the person, URL etc, issue is on LinkedIn side.**  
I've spent 10 minutes to get control over account of my wife and I didn't used any tools. Anything except LinkedIn and my mailbox!  
Also I've looked at 4 accounts of my colleagues and 2 of them was "infected".


2. **Check your profile settings, if you'll find any mails in your profile you didn't added - remove them ASAP.**

### We wan't details!

I've just sent report to LinkedIn security team and awaiting for response from them, so I don't want to share details until this will be fixed. Thank you all for understanding.

Once LinkedIn fix it, or reject the issue - I'll provide step-by-step explanation with screenshots.
