Welcome to yet another blog about Software Development, Big Data, Architecture and Management. But we have a difference...

**This is the collaborative blog, open for changes like Wikipedia, but organized as GitHub open-source project. So now you are able to improve existing posts as well as create your own in the way you like**

If you <S>_want to fix a bug_</S> found mistake or you want to <S>_implement new feature_</S> add more details to an article or even create your own live article - just go ahead with GitHub workflow and send us [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)!

### What?! Again!

Do you remember your feelings when you read somebody's blog post and found inaccuracies, outdated facts or just a places which can be improved? Usually you just can't do this because you have to contact author and discuss how post may be improved. Then, if author have a time, post will be updated, maybe.

Some time ago I've created my [personal technical blog](http://sotnikdv.github.io/common/2015/03/29/welcome.html), wrote few articles and proposed to my colleagues do the same. Few months later, as many of other bloggers, I've realized that:
   - articles may be innacurate or contain mistakes
   - articles become outdated
   - somebody may have more knowledge than you on some topics, so reader potentially can improve article

**I spent a lot of time to create some of my articles and now I was faced with a choice: keep them locked in my personal blog until they will become outdated or contribute them to community and let people improve them.** 

So I decided to establish some kind of process to let readers improve articles. Also I have need review and merge process on my side. **But wait!.. If we need workflow similar to open-source code project, let's create blog as the open-sorce repository-based project!**

And if it's open-source project, then it shouldn't be personal, let other people add their own articles and let every article have an author and list of editors.

This is why this project was created and now I'm migrating my posts to it.

### I have my own personal blog, I don't want to work for THIS blog!

At least, this project will allow **you** to change **existing** posts, if you'll find mistake or want to make them better. In this case you'll be added to the list of contributors for this article.

But if you have the same concern about your personal blog and you want to create your article in open-source way - feel free to join and send pull request. And don't forget to mark your article with your name, photo and URL to your site. Also you may create re-post to your personal blog as I do.

### So, this is YOUR blog!

This project was **started** by me but not belongs to me. There is no your or my blog here, there are articles from different authors with a list of editors.

I'm just mainteiner of the project and author of some articles. You can take participation or you can fork it until you are following licenses for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Kasper theme](https://github.com/rosario/kasper) and [Greative Commons License, BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) for content.

### Yet another blogging platform?

Forget about blogging platforms, it's the GitHub-based open-source project, focused on posts instead of code. So you can edit any posts, work with GIT repository, send pull requests or fork the project.

### Who will merge changes?

As most of open-source projects - maintainers. Currently it's only me, but I hope this will be changed soon.

### Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and ....

Feel free to [fork this blog on the GitHub](https://github.com/rndblog/rndblog.github.io) and don't forget to update configuration. Also see [this article from my personal blog](http://sotnikdv.github.io/common/beginners/2015/03/29/do-you-wanna-blog-too.html) for information about configuration and maintenance.

As for content, please preserve information about an authors, this is required by the license. Also I'd like to kindly ask you to preserve information about origin (to let reader find a main copy) and, if possible, send updates to this upstream.

### I want to be a maintainer too

I see no better way then already used in open-source projects, when top contributors became mainteners. But if you really feel that you don't want to rely on existing process and maintainers - fork it!
