This is the incomplete list of common mistakes I’ve seen while working on presale in different companies including my own plus information from a public sources. 

Most of them are violation of common sense, so usually it’s hard to believe how often such mistake can be met.

### Process
  
Most critical issues are often result of malformed process or even it’s absence. Usually such issues can be fixed easily, because all is required it’s a reasonable and lightweight (for me it’s synonym of clear) process to follow.

##### 1. No process at all
  
*There is no greater evil than anarchy - Sophocles*  

A lot of presale started with no formal process definition. 

**As a result** it’s hard to manage and coordinate work while presale and proposal lifecycle, distribute work and responsibilities.

##### 2. No requirements to artifacts
  
Very often there is no list of required artifacts and/or requirements to such artifacts, intermediate and final.

**As a result:**  
- it’s hard to manage and coordinate work while presale due to lack of visibility and information, because many intermediate artifacts like PoC reports, Request for Proposal, activity logs etc. are not created at all  
- a lot of valuable information lost after presale and can’t be reused  
- final artifacts (proposal) may not satisfy requirements  

##### 3. No post-mortem analyze and statistic, no process improvements
  
*“Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.” ― Edmund Burke*

Post-mortem analyze of presale results and activity is a mandatory step to understand reasons of success or fail and improve process for better results. 

Unfortunately, this step is often omitted and many companies have no presale statistic and do not fix their processes.

**As a result**, many companies have no understanding of how efficient their presale process and is it need to be improved. Without process improvement same issues affects presale process again and again.

##### 4. No fail-fast
  
*A fail-fast system is designed to immediately report at its interface any failure or condition that is likely to lead to failure. Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early*

This mistake is in absence of intermediate waypoints, when team should analyze presale state and results and decide, should they continue presale activity or it should be canceled or restarted with new information (requirements, team, customer etc.)

Presale process is an expensive procedure. Also usually resources, which are used by presale process, are limited in the company. So fail-fast pattern may help to avoid unneeded resources consumption or can free such resources in favor of other presale activities.

**As a result** of this mistake, companies spend a lot of resources and time to unpromising presale projects and realize this too late. Also this usually means that some presale projects will not be started due to lack of resources.

##### 5. There is no assigned person who will lead technical activity
  
I don’t know why, but this is very common issue. 

Usually, there is no single assigned person who will lead technical activity on presale and will be responsible for technical part of proposal and coordinate technical work.

**As a result**, presale person (presale lead) is trying to manage technical activity (investigation, PoC, creation/support of the technical part of proposal etc.) and even discuss technical questions on meetings.

##### 6. More than one technical specialists involved without assignment to lead technical activity
  
That’s odd, but next common mistake is (and moreover, they frequently can be met together!) to involve few mature technical specialists and do not assign leader of the technical activity.

**As a result**, such specialists do not interact with each other and do not coordinate activity at all. This leads to big mess on meetings with customer and while working on technical part of proposal.

If presale lead will try to manage such technical work personally, usually he/she-will be overloaded with technical questions he/she is not familiar. Otherwise, result will be highly dependent on ability of a newly created “team” to be self-organized immediately (so almost never).

##### 7. Overcomplicated process
  
*The worst thing in this world, next to anarchy, is government. - Henry Ward Beecher*

Opposite side of 1 it’s overcomplicated process or process, which can’t be understood without long training.

**As a result**, such process will be simply ignored by all or (what is even worse) by some participants. On the other hands, strict following to such process will dramatically decrease performance and motivation.

Usually such processes was met in companies with no post-mortem analyze practice.

##### 8. No any structured information storage 
  
*Most of the great written sources appear to represent the final stage of a long oral tradition - History of Humanity: From the 3rd millenium to the 7th century B.C.*

Last (but not least) process-related problem is absence of storage to store/exchange artifacts and information while presale.

Sometimes there is no any other source of an information than memories of participants and other way to exchange documents than mailthreads. A lot of information simply not reflected in any written source and exists only in memory of presale participants.

**As a result** of such terrible approach, work on presale is complicated and most of an information can’t be recovered and reused after presale.

### First contact with customer
  
Few mistakes which usually can be occured on the first steps of presale process. Usually it’s a result of normal process flaw violation (see “What is Presale and Who is Presale Lead” section above).

##### 9. No Demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects business problems
  
Areas of specialty of Presales include demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects business problems. It will be done in a manner that highlights an easy method to solve those problems using the tools available within the vendors suite of product.

Sometimes this step is ignored partially (when no materials related and specific to customer’s business problem is shown) or completely (when no any materials about company presented)

**As a result** of such approach it’s very hard to establish close contact between team and customer to understand customer’s needs and create Request for Proposal.

##### 10. A lot of technical specialists on a first meeting, who are not prepared, had no relation and should not be involved
  
*To be, or not to be, that is the question -  William Shakespeare*

It’s hard to decide is this just a different presale strategy or attempt to compensate lack of preparation by involving few technical specialists, who are not prepared, to the first meeting with customer. 

Usually such specialists (skilled, experienced and with high grades) have no specific knowledges, related to customer’s needs and not prepared to such meeting.

**As a result** of such approach, few technical specialists start extracting of information about customer’s needs even before demonstration of company’s information and experience in the area. 

Maybe this is just another presale strategy, but in combination with Mistakes #5 and #6 result is usually unpredictable.

### Wrong presale steps order
  
Presale process it’s a sequence of a steps, where proper order of a steps is important to avoid unneeded effort.

##### 11. Starting technical activity and analyze even before first contact, immediately after discovery step
  
Sometimes technical investigation (with dedicated resources!) and analyze may be started immediately after discovery step, before first contact meeting and real information about customer’s needs.

In combination with Mistakes #5, #6 and #10 result is overwhelmingly terrible, because even if research occasionally matched real customer’s needs, there is no chance to use such research results on meeting due to absence of coordination between meeting participants. Most of them may be even not aware about a fact of such research.

**Result** of this mistake are resources spent for nothing and demotivation of participants of such research.

##### 12. Difference between task definition from initial contact person and decision maker when starting analyze before Request for Proposal.
  
Commonly used presale sequence requires to start investigation only after all decision makers and knowledge sources are identified, presales have a detailed knowledge about customer’s needs, Request for Proposal is created and reviewed by customer.

Violation of this rule may lead to early start of investigation with dedicated resources with wrong understanding of customer’s needs.

**Result** of this mistake are resources spent for nothing and demotivation of participants of such research.

### Improper resources assignment
  
Every step in presale process may require dedicated resources to complete or can be done in background. Improper resources assignment leads to few common mistakes.

##### 13. No dedicated resources to make investigation, PoC and create proposal
  
Sometimes presale project have no (enough or at all) dedicated resources to make investigation, create PoC and work on proposal document. In such situations technical specialists which are full-time busy on existing project may be involved to work on proposal in background or in a free time.

Such approach may be acceptable in case of emergencies, but as a systematic approach it’s a huge impact to performance and motivation of people involved, existing project delivery and also  seriously affects proposal and presale results.

##### 14. Overuse of dedicated resources
  
Opposite side to the previous mistake is excessive use of dedicated resources while presale.

This can be improper activity like analyze or PoC etc. (see 11 for example) or usage of dedicated resources for steps, which can be done by presale lead only or by other participants in background.

**As a result** of this mistake resources will be spent for nothing, this will increase presale cost or block other presale project due to lack of resources.

### Communication
  
##### 15. No close contact between company’s technical specialists and customer’s technical specialists and management
  
In fact, presale process (in our case, fair play and win-win model) mostly based on ability to show to customer expertise and explain solution proposed with risks, pros and cons. 

So it’s continuous process, from the first meeting and up to sale, where sale it’s a final step only.

**As a result**, absence of close contact between company’s technical specialists and customer’s technical specialists and management affects two different areas:  
- understanding of customer’s needs
- sale process
