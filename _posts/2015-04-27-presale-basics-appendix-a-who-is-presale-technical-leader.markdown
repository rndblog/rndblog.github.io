### Responsibilities

TL is responsible for:  
- Technical investigations, PoC and required documentation and presentations  
- Technical part of proposal document  
- Estimates  
- Form, control and manage team to make investigation or PoC (if required).  
- All technical questions, internal or from client’s side  
- Technical part of any meeting while Presale (if meeting is technical only - will lead such meetings)  
- Documentation of all technical solutions made and log of technical work to keep information available while and after presale process  
- Communication with a client to get, clarify and discuss requirements, then to present technical part of proposal  
- Take participation in daily communication with customer  
- Take participation in post-mortem analyse  
- In case of assignment canceled by Presale Lead, transfer all knowledges to newly assigned TL  

### Rights

First and most important right of potential TL is to decline assignment proposal.

Presale Lead may discuss any questions with TL, but only TL makes final decisions on:  
- who and when need to be involved to presale process for technical area  
- when to start PoC, which questions need to be covered and how many details need to be provided.  
- who and when will work on technical part of proposal and which topics and how need to be covered  

### Required skills and qualities

Accordingly to responsibilities we can define required skills for TL:  
- Quick learning  
- Fluent english  
- At least basic knowledges in proposal’s area  
- Ability to get/clarify/discuss requirements  
- Communication skills to interact with customer and team  
- Responsibility and ability to plan own work  
- Ability to work proactively and without constant control  
- Basic management skills to organize work of involved technical specialists is a plus, but additional manager can be involved instead.  

Also we can define required qualities  
- Be mature and wise enough to keep balance between following current priorities and limitations and what is required for success   
- Be able to work with current Presale Lead  

### Who can play this role

TL is a person with broad responsibility and some irrevocable rights, so need to be chosen very carefully.

Many Architects, Technical Leads and Development Managers may meet those requirements. Also some BA can be involved, if they are mature enough
