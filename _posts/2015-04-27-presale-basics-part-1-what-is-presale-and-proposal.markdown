The real mystery of IT world is that a lot of presale people have basic understanding of technical side of presale. In the same time, technical specialists often have just basic understanding of what is presale and proposal, what is important and why, how to build proposal lifecycle process.

In this serie of articles I’ll try to summarize all my knowledge about presale process, common mistakes, how to avoid them and will propose formal process for proposal lifecycle. Hope that this material will be a good starting point.

###Target audience###
This is description of presale process mostly from the point of view of technical specialist, responsible for technical side of proposal (technical lead of presale). In the same time, as owner of IT company in the past, I will overview and briefly explain the rest of the presale process and how proposal-related activities fits overall presale activity.

Information from these articles may be useful for presale persons and management, who want to get deep understanding of what is technical side of a proposal, how it should be created, how to interact with technical specialists on both sides of the process and what are the common mistakes and how to avoid them.

Nevertheless, main purpose of these articles is to share knowledge with technical leads, involved in presale, about what is presale and how to deal with it.

###Limits of applicability###

In this discussion we will discuss part of the sale process in **outsource model**, when we need to propose to customer **technical solution** and **team**, to implement it.

We will be focused on **proposal** creation and support, from a first contact with customer and up to post-presentation proposal assistance: typical issues, analyze and preferred process.

We are discussing presale which is built onto win-win model and “fair play” principles, when company have real expertise in area and resources to satisfy customer’s needs.

###What is Presale and Who is Presale Lead###

Presale is a **process** or a set of **activities** normally carried out **before a customer is acquired**, though sometimes presales also extends into the period the product or service is delivered to the customer

The task of a **presale person** (**presale lead** in our discussion) starts from the initial contact phase and often ends once the customer is acquired i.e. sale is made. In some cases, presale person also provide some initial or transitional support post sale.

The responsibilities of presale person differ from organization to organization but in general include:

1. Solution/Proposal Preparation based on Customers Requirements
1. Proof of Concept Creation
1. Creation of Marketing Documents
1. Product or Solution demonstrations
1. ... and any other activity required to generate business

In Software Industry and IT Services Industry products and services are often heavily customizable and also because the requirements of different customers are often unique. So role of presale person falls right in the middle marrying the customer needs to the (provider) company's services or products. 

**Presale person** understands what the customer needs, develops an initial view of the solution the customer needs, then tailors the product or service of his company to meet what the customer needs, explains (or helps sell) this solution to the customer, helps close the deal or sale and often stays on to ensure that the delivery team or product specialists that follow him provide the intended solution. 

Areas of specialty of Presales include:

1. **Discovery** – a means to uncover details of business problems that the prospect has. The presales person will understand and closely analyse the prospects requirements.
1. **Request for Proposal (RFP)** – presales have a detailed knowledge of the product suite, in addition to its application to business problems. As such, presales are frequently involved in technical details in RFP preparation.
1. **Preparation** – tailoring a prospect specific presentation or software presentation that precisely meets the needs of the prospect.
1. **Demonstration** – A demonstration of the vendor product that specifically addresses the prospects business problems. It will be done in a manner that highlights an easy method to solve those problems using the tools available within the vendors suite of product.
1. **Proposal assistance** – Given presales were involved in the sale since the discovery of the prospect business problems, presales will often complete the business analysis and technical component of a sales proposal.

###What is Proposal###

In general, proposal is a document that lists and defines the technical requirements of a contract or project, and explains the approach and plan formulated to address them.

Proposal offers a plan to fill a need and answers questions about **what** is proposed, **which problem (why)** will be solved, **how** to do it **(schedule and resources)** and **how much** it is going to cost. 

We must ascertain the level of knowledge that audience possesses and take the positions of all readers into account. We must also discern whether readers will be members of technical community, of technical discourse community, or of both, and then use the appropriate materials and language to appeal to both. 

We might provide, for those outside of specific area of expertise, an executive summary written in non-technical language, or might include a glossary of terms that explains technical language use in the body of the proposal and/or attach appendices that explain technical information in generally understood language.

Usually sections “**what** is proposed and **which problem (why)** will be solved” will be deeply analyzed by a customer’s technical specialists. In the same time, decision makers are usually managers who will be focused on **which problem (why)** will be solved, **how (schedule and resources)** and **cost** parts of the proposal plus will take into account feedback of from technical specialists.

Usually proposal need to be reviewed and approved before it will be shown to a customer.
It’s highly recommended to have two different review sessions: 

* technical review of “**what** is proposed and **which problem (why)** will be solved” section with technical leads and/or architects
* overall review with management, who is responsible for resources and finances, so CEO and CFO or their representatives need to be involved.

Accordingly to the scope of this discussion, we will leave overall proposal review process outboard and will NOT analyze it and propose process for this particular part.
