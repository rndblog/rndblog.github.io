#### Blog can be the open-source project!

Welcome to  one more blog about Research in IT, from Management to Architecture. But wait...

**This particular one is an open-source project, based on the GitHub!**

So if you ~~want to fix a bug~~ found mistake, or outdated information or you want to ~~implement new feature~~ add something to an article - just go ahead and create pull request!

Also this is not a personal, but collaborative blog, so you may contribute your own article to the ~~code~~articlebase. Open as Wikipedia, but as an open-source GitHub project. And every article will have have author and list of editors.
