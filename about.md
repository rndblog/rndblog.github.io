#### ... and a bit more about this particular one

Yet another blog about Software Development, Big Data, Architecture and Management. But we have something different...

**This is the collaborative blog, open for changes like Wikipedia, but organized as GitHub open-source project. So now you are able to improve existing posts as well as create your own in the way you like!**

If you <S>_want to fix a bug_</S> found mistake or you want to <S>_implement new feature_</S> add more details to an article or even create your own live article - just go ahead with GitHub workflow and send us pull request!

And if you still need some answers - please take a look at the [Welcome Arcticle](http://rndblog.github.io/common/2015/08/28/welcome.html)
