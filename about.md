This is **collaborative** blog about Software Development, Big Data, Architecture and Management which is **open for changes** like Wikipedia and organized as GitHub **open-source project**.

You are able to **create your own** articles or **update existing** and become article's editor.

So if you <s><i>want to fix a bug</i></s> found mistake or you want to <s><i>implement new feature</i></s> add more details to an article or even create your own live article - just go ahead with GitHub workflow and send us pull request!

And if you still need some answers - please take a look at the [Welcome Arcticle](http://rndblog.github.io/common/2015/08/28/welcome.html)
